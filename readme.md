## Final

### Running the application

Please open the file beepboop.xcworkspace (as opposed to the file beepboop.xcodeproj) in XCode, and run the application on an iPhone 12 simulator. 

### Note about Custom Alarm Ringtone

As of XCode 8.0+, notification sound duration is as follows:

When phone is unlocked and app is running in the background, sound plays once for 6 seconds then is cut off.
When phone is locked, sound plays for full duration (Apple has 30 seconds max limit).
In any case, the sound will stop once user clicks on the notification, swipes on the banner, adjusts volume/presses top right button on phone, or swipes down from the top to display Notification Center.
To configure the notification sound (alarm ringtone) to play for its full duration, one method is to go to the phone Settings > Notifications > beepboop and then set "Banner Style" to "Persistent". Note that the default Banner style setting is "Temporary", which plays notification sounds for a max duration of 6 seconds).
See https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/66925 for more information.

### Deviations

#### Alarm Popup Screen
Originally, we were going to display this screen when users clicked on the
navigation banner when an alarm goes off. Unfortunately, we were unable
to find a way to do this. After comprehensive Google searches and attending
TA and Prof office hours, we've decided to push off this functionality to a later phase.

#### Adding Friends Screen
Simplified the UI design for the Contacts Screen. We decided to change the title
of the page to Friends. Then when adding friends, we changed the UI so that 
the user now will just enter the email and click the button to send the request. 
We made this change just to keep the UI simpler and more user friendly. 

#### Notification Screen
We decided to add in a new screen to the navigation bar only for Notifications. 
Here the user can see all notifications related to shared alarms, friend requests, etc.
We made this change so that the user would have a central place where they could 
see all their relevant notifications (hopefully making the experience easier).

#### Sharing
We have implemented the front end for sharing and are mid way implementing it
in the backend. We ran into some issues when implementing the backend that
took longer than expected to resolve. There is also an issue with opening the share screen
that causes the app to display an error message and not add an alarm as intended. 

#### Login/Sign Up Screens (Alpha)

We decided to slightly modify the design of these screens by integrating the
process of signing up with FB/Google into the Login screen, as per the 
recommendations from the initial design feedback. There is now a button on the
Login screen that takes a user from the Login screen to the Sign Up screen. 

#### Alarm Creation Screen (Alpha)

We modified the Alarm Creation screen from the initial design to now display 
time, date, and sound in Picker Views. The title is a customized text field. We
added a toggle for snoozing (no functionality). 

The user has the option to set the recurring option for an alarm on the UI. 
However, due to issues with notifications not anticipated, we have decided to 
move the recurring alarm notification functionality to a later phase.

#### Home Screen (Alpha)

The tab bar has been redesigned with a different set of icons, titles, and 
colors.

The Alarm Table View cell design deviates from the card style cells shown in the
initial design. The current design will be revisited in the future.
